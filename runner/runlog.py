"""The run log: one complete, fixed-place record of every launch, and the facts a failure needs.

`nfclaw run` launches Nextflow from `--outdir`, so everything a reader needs after the fact sits at
paths that do not depend on where they are standing:

- `<outdir>/provenance/logs/run.log` — the whole launch, with child-output lines prefixed by `| `
  to distinguish them from nfclaw's status controls: nfclaw's
  header (command, launch dir, Nextflow log, advisories), Nextflow's stdout and stderr interleaved as
  produced, and a last line stating the outcome. A relaunch (`--resume`) appends, so the attempt that
  failed is never overwritten by the one that fixes it.
- Nextflow's own log — `<outdir>/.nextflow.log` (or `NXF_LOG_FILE`, resolved against `--outdir`).

Nothing here guesses a cause. On failure nfclaw quotes Nextflow's own error report verbatim — plus
the exception chain behind it from Nextflow's log, where the real reason is often the only thing
written — and names the files that hold the rest; the reader (or agent) does the diagnosis.
