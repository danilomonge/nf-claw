"""Resolve and materialize a *specific* version of a pipeline: a release, or unreleased `dev`.

`nfclaw` pins each pipeline's submodule to its latest release. This module lets a
user run any other published release tag instead: it validates the requested tag
against the real upstream tags, checks it out into a git-ignored per-version cache
(a worktree sharing the submodule's object store), and returns a `SubmoduleStatus`
pointing at that tree — the same value the rest of the runner already consumes for
the pinned version. The default (no version) path is unchanged.

`dev` is the one non-release accepted: every nf-core pipeline develops on a `dev` branch and
releases from it, so it holds the code that is not released yet (Nextflow's `-r dev`). A branch
moves, so it is resolved to its current head commit on every request and materialized as an
immutable per-commit tree (`.versions/dev-<commit>/`): a replay or a concurrent run never sees the
code change under it, and provenance records exactly which commit ran.
