# Chaining Pipelines

`nfclaw chain run` executes multiple nf-core pipelines in sequence (e.g. `fetchngs` → `rnaseq` → `differentialabundance`),
initiating each subsequent stage only after the preceding stage has **succeeded**, and automatically preparing
downstream inputs from upstream outputs.

It functions as a linear orchestrator:
- No complex DAG syntax, no daemon, no external scheduler.
- Every stage executes as a full, standard `nfclaw run` inside `<outdir>/NN-<stage>/`, with its own preflight parameter validation, sibling directory locking, run log, and provenance bundle.
- Durable chain state, handoff snapshots, and unified logs are maintained in `<outdir>/chain/`.

```bash
nfclaw chain edges                                       # list all registered pipeline handoffs
nfclaw chain edges fetchngs                              # list handoffs originating from or feeding fetchngs
nfclaw chain run spec.json --outdir /abs/chain --check   # validate all stages and handoffs; run nothing
nfclaw chain run spec.json --outdir /abs/chain           # execute the full workflow
nfclaw chain status /abs/chain                           # inspect stage outcomes and verify cryptographic lineage
```

## 1. The Specification File (`spec.json`)

The chain spec is written in JSON (or YAML if `pyyaml` is installed). Relative file paths in the spec
resolve against the directory where `nfclaw` was invoked. The spec recorded in `<outdir>/chain/chain.json`
is normalized to absolute paths.

```json
{
  "profile": "docker",
  "nxf_env": {"NXF_JVM_ARGS": "-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true"},
  "limits": {"cpus": 8, "memory": "30.GB", "time": "12.h"},
  "stages": [
    {
      "pipeline": "fetchngs",
      "input": "/data/accessions.csv",
      "retries": 2
    },
    {
      "pipeline": "rnaseq",
      "params": {"genome": "GRCh38"},
      "pipeline_version": "3.18.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Chain-Level Options
These settings apply globally to all stages unless overridden by an individual stage:

| Option | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `profile` | string | Nextflow profile (default: `docker`). |
| `nxf_ver` | string | Pin the Nextflow engine version (`NXF_VER`) across all stages. |
| `nxf_env` | object | Environment variables passed to Nextflow (e.g., `{"NXF_OFFLINE": "true"}`). |
| `config` | array of strings | Extra Nextflow configuration files passed via `-c`. |
| `limits` | object | Global resource ceiling: `{"cpus": N, "memory": "SIZE", "time": "DURATION"}`. Translates to Nextflow's `process.resourceLimits`. |
| `allow_spaces` | boolean | Allow paths containing spaces (default: `false`). |

### Stage-Level Keys
Options set on a stage override or merge with chain-level options:

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pipeline` | string | Yes | Name of a tracked pipeline in the library. |
| `id` | string | No | Unique stage identifier (default: pipeline name; must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$`). |
| `input` | string | No | Explicit `--input` for the stage (typically stage 1); overrides a handoff's input if provided. |
| `params` | object | No | Pipeline-specific parameters (e.g., `{"genome": "GRCh38", "aligner": "star_salmon"}`). Look up allowed flags in the pipeline's `reference.md`. |
| `params_file` | string | No | Path to a parameter JSON/YAML file. |
| `pipeline_version` | string | No | Pinned release tag (e.g., `3.14.0`) or `dev`. |
| `demo` | boolean | No | Appends the pipeline's bundled `test` profile. |
| `retries` | integer | No | Maximum automatic retries (using Nextflow `-resume`) upon task or pipeline failure (default: `0`). Never retries on parameter or schema validation errors. |
| `handoff` | object or string | No | Custom inline handoff rule object or path to a custom rule JSON file, replacing the library registry rule. |
| `nxf_ver` | string | No | Overrides engine version for this specific stage (essential when chaining an older pipeline release with a modern one). |
| `nxf_env` | object | No | Merges stage-specific `NXF_*` environment variables over chain-level variables. |
| `config` | array of strings | No | Additional stage-specific configuration files passed via `-c`. |
| `limits` | object | No | Stage-specific resource ceilings overriding chain-level limits. |

### Preflight Probing Before Launch
Before starting any process, `nfclaw chain run` validates:
1. Every stage's pipeline and requested version exists and resolves.
2. Every handoff rule satisfies both upstream output schemas and downstream input schemas.
3. Every stage's explicit parameters pass schema validation (parameters supplied by upstream handoffs are deferred).
4. `nextflow config` resolves and parses configuration files under the exact Nextflow engine specified for each stage. A configuration syntax error in stage 3 fails immediately at minute 0, rather than crashing after stage 1 has executed for hours.

### Concurrency Locking
`runner/chain.py` locks `<outdir>/chain/.lock` via a non-blocking POSIX flock. If another chain process is active in the same directory, it terminates immediately with `ErrorCode.ENVIRONMENT`.

### Unified Logging
- The chain-wide execution log is written to `<outdir>/chain/logs/chain.log`.
- Background monitoring: `tail -n 1 <outdir>/chain/logs/chain.log` displays the terminal outcome line:  
  `==> nfclaw chain finished <timestamp>: <outcome>`
- Stopping a chain: `kill <pid>` stops the running stage cleanly, flushes the log, and shuts down Nextflow.

## 3. Handoff Rules and Transformations

Handoff rules describe how outputs published by an upstream pipeline are adapted into inputs for
a downstream pipeline. Registered rules reside in `handoffs/<upstream>/<downstream>.json`.

Example: `handoffs/fetchngs/rnaseq.json`:
```json
{
  "description": "feed fetched FASTQ samplesheet into rnaseq",
  "upstream_params": {
    "nf_core_pipeline": "rnaseq"
  },
  "params": {
    "input": {
      "samplesheet": "samplesheet/samplesheet.csv",
      "provides": ["sample", "fastq_1", "fastq_2", "strandedness"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Parameter Source Types
| Source Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `samplesheet` | Copies and adapts an upstream samplesheet. `provides` declares guaranteed columns checked during static drift checks. | `fetchngs` → `rnaseq`, `fetchngs` → `mag` |
| `build` | Synthesizes a new samplesheet from matching output files. Uses `{placeholders}` for row grouping and column templating. | `bamtofastq` → `rnaseq` |
| `file` | Maps a single published output file to a downstream parameter. Globs must match exactly one file. | `rnaseq` → `differentialabundance` (`--matrix`) |
| `upstream_param` | Reuses a resolved parameter value from the upstream run's `params.json`. | `rnaseq` `--gtf` → `differentialabundance` `--gtf` |

### Samplesheet Transformations
When `samplesheet` is used, transformations are applied in a strict, predictable order:
1. `rename`: Rename columns (`{"fastq_1": "short_reads_1"}`).
2. `set`: Set values or template expressions for every row (`{"lane": "{run_accession}"}`).
3. `add_empty`: Insert declared columns that the upstream sheet lacks.
4. `drop_rows_not_allowed`: Filter out rows containing values rejected by the downstream schema.
5. `require_values`: Assert that specific columns must contain non-empty values before launch.

### Metagenomic Co-Assembly Safety
In metagenomic workflows (`fetchngs` → `mag`, `detaxizer` → `mag`), nf-core/mag treats identical sample `group` identifiers as an instruction to pool reads across samples for co-assembly. To preserve biological integrity:
- The default registered rules assign each sample its own independent group: `"group": "{sample}"`.
- Pooling samples requires an explicit custom inline handoff rule accompanied by domain justification.

## 4. Failure, Recovery and Resume

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Preflight check failure | No processes launched; exits with code `1`. |
| Pipeline failure with `retries > 0` | The failed stage is automatically relaunched using Nextflow `-resume`. |
| Exhausted retries or non-retryable failure | Chain execution halts immediately; downstream stages remain `pending`; exits with code `1`. |
| Handoff generation failure (`[handoff_failed]`) | Upstream stage is marked succeeded; downstream stage is not launched; exits with code `1`. |
| Interrupt signal (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`) | Running stage shuts down Nextflow cleanly; exits with code `128 + signal` or `130`. |

### Resuming a Failed Chain
To continue a chain after fixing a parameter or environmental issue:
```bash
nfclaw chain run spec.json --outdir /abs/chain --resume
```
When resuming:
1. Succeeded stages are frozen and verified: modifying the spec for an already-succeeded stage is rejected.
2. The failed stage resumes execution using Nextflow's cached intermediate tasks.
3. New stages may be appended to the end of a completed chain to extend an existing analysis.

---

## 5. Provenance and Cryptographic Lineage

Chaining records checksum evidence for the links between stages:
- Each stage's `run_manifest.json` contains a `chain` block recording chain ID, stage index, and upstream dependencies.
- The handoff record stores its rule digest and dependency inventories. Downstream stages snapshot
  the handed-over local files and samplesheet in `inputs.sha256`.
- Upstream outputs are verified against `outputs.sha256` before ingestion by downstream handoffs.

### Chain Verification (`nfclaw chain status`)
```bash
nfclaw chain status /abs/chain
```
The status command:
1. Validates that every completed stage manifest matches the recorded chain state.
2. Checks that live stage outputs on disk match their original `outputs.sha256` digests.
3. Compares handoff files and reference inventories with upstream evidence and the input hashes
   recorded by the downstream stage, including internal reference directories.
4. Exits with code `0` if all links are verified and complete, code `3` if stages are currently executing, and code `1` if any failure or discrepancy is detected.

These checks verify the recorded links and live outputs. They do not independently verify every
initial input or configuration, prove analytical accuracy, or authenticate evidence against someone
who can rewrite the entire bundle. Static rule checks use parameter/input schemas and declared
published paths; the repository has no general upstream output schema. File existence and historical
identity are checked at runtime. A configuration probe that fails to execute or times out blocks
both `--check` and execution, rather than being treated as a passing result.
