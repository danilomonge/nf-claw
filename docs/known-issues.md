# Known Issues & Troubleshooting

Most run-time failures fall into two categories: **environment** (host, network, or path issues — fixable via `nfclaw run` flags or environment adjustments) and **upstream pipeline defects** (bugs in a specific pinned nf-core release). nf-claw wraps pipelines **unmodified**, so upstream defects are documented here and reported upstream, never patched directly into submodules.

> [!NOTE]
> **Parameter Syntax & Normalization:**
> `nfclaw run` normalizes dashes and underscores interchangeably (e.g. `--skip-busco` and `--skip_busco` are equivalent, whereas raw Nextflow requires the pipeline's exact spelling).
>
> **Values Starting with a Dash:** When passing parameter values that begin with a hyphen (such as tool pass-through flags like rnaseq's `--extra_star_align_args`): use the `=` syntax `--extra_star_align_args='--outFilterMismatchNmax 5'` or pass them via `--params-file`. The two-token syntax `--extra_star_align_args '--outFilterMismatchNmax 5'` is rejected fast with an `unknown parameter` error to prevent unintended flag misinterpretation.

When a run fails, nfclaw's error diagnostic quotes Nextflow's own error report (including the full `Caused by:` chain from `.nextflow.log` if hidden from the console) and references absolute paths to:
1. The unified launch log (`<outdir>/provenance/logs/run.log`), ending with the terminal outcome line.
2. Nextflow's internal engine log (`<outdir>/.nextflow.log`).
3. The failing task's `.command.err` (accompanied by `.command.log` and `.command.sh`).

## Environment

### `nfclaw` aborts with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'runner'`
- **Symptom:** The installed `nfclaw` command fails immediately — before doing any work — with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'runner'` (or `'librarian'`).
- **Why:** `nfclaw` is a console script that imports the repo's `runner` package, which relies on the `pip install -e .` editable install being active in the **same** Python the command runs under. Two things break that import:
  1. **A space in the install path:** Python's `site` module does not execute an editable install's path hook when the virtualenv/site-packages path contains a space, so `runner` never lands on `sys.path` (this repo already requires a space-free path for *runs*; the same applies to the *install*).
  2. **Python interpreter mismatch:** The editable install was performed with a **different Python** than the one in `nfclaw`'s shebang (e.g. a `--user` install whose site-packages is not on that interpreter's path). This occurs before nfclaw code executes, so it cannot be caught by runtime space checks.
- **Fix:**
  - Use a **space-free path** for both the repo and the virtualenv (on macOS also avoid iCloud paths), and run `pip install -e .` inside the virtualenv you actually use.
  - Or skip the console script and use the **no-install equivalent from the repo root**: `python3 -m runner <cmd>` (maintenance runs the same way: `make <target>`, or `python3 -m librarian.<module>` — e.g. `python3 -m librarian.write_skill --all`). It needs no install — the repo root is already on `sys.path` — and resolves the pinned pipelines correctly.

### Path contains a space — checked before the run, fails fast
- **Symptom:** A tool fails with a split path (e.g. `cannot create /vol/draft 2/...: Permission denied`, `Got unexpected extra argument(s)`, or a module building shell commands breaks).
- **Why:** Many bioinformatics tools (and Nextflow's internal work directory) build shell commands without quoting paths, causing spaces to split arguments. This affects **macOS and Linux** alike.
- **How nfclaw handles it:** `nfclaw run` checks the **repo path, the Nextflow work directory and `--outdir`** *before* launching and **fails fast**, naming exactly which path has the space — a deterministic check, no guessing.
- **Fix:**
  - Move the repository to a space-free path (strongly recommended).
  - Or set a space-free work directory: `--nxf-env NXF_WORK=/a/space-free/dir`, and use a space-free `--outdir`.
  - Or, if you know your pipeline tolerates spaces, pass `--allow-spaces` to bypass the preflight check.

### IPv6-only host — JVM can't reach GitHub
- **Symptom:** `java.net.SocketException: Network is unreachable` while Nextflow downloads `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/configs/master/nfcore_custom.config`.
- **Why:** The host has no default IPv4 route; the JVM prefers IPv4 by default and never attempts IPv6.
- **Fix:** `--nxf-env NXF_JVM_ARGS=-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true`. To skip remote config fetches entirely (offline): `--nxf-env NXF_OFFLINE=true`.
- **Dual Requirement on IPv6 Hosts:** On an IPv6-only host you usually need BOTH this *and* the Docker host-network config (next section) together: the JVM flag fixes Nextflow's own GitHub download, while host-network fixes DNS *inside* containers — neither alone is sufficient:
  ```bash
  nfclaw run <name> --nxf-env NXF_JVM_ARGS=-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true \
                    --config host-net.config …
  ```

### No network at run time — a tool downloads a database
- **Symptom:** A step (e.g. BUSCO) hangs then fails trying to fetch a database it requires.
- **Fix:** Disable that step via parameters. Booleans work from the CLI, e.g. `--skip-busco true` (or put `{"skip_busco": true}` in a JSON file and pass it as `--params-file params.json`).

### A process requests more memory than the host has — aborts before any work
- **Symptom:** A run aborts at scheduling time because a single step requests more RAM than the machine has, e.g. `Process requirement exceeds available memory -- req: 80 GB; avail: 62.8 GB`. Seen with `detaxizer` 1.3.0 run with `--classification_bbduk`: its `BBMAP_BBDUK` step carries nf-core's `process_high` label, which `conf/base.config` sizes at `80.GB * task.attempt` — more than a typical workstation or small VM has.
- **Why:** An nf-core `base.config` sizes each process by a resource *label* (`process_low/medium/high/high_memory`) tuned for an HPC cluster; one high-memory step can exceed a small host's physical RAM, and Nextflow refuses to schedule a task it knows cannot fit.
- **Fix:** Put a ceiling on the whole run with `--limit-cpus` / `--limit-memory` / `--limit-time`, sized to the host machine:
  ```bash
  nfclaw run rnaseq --input ss.csv --outdir results -profile docker \
    --limit-cpus 4 --limit-memory 15.GB --limit-time 1.h
  ```
  nfclaw writes these as Nextflow's [`process.resourceLimits`](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#set-max-resources) and passes the generated config with `-c` — the mechanism nf-core prescribes, and the same one its own `test` profiles use (which is why `--demo` never hits this and a real run does). The ceiling applies to **every** process *and every retry*, so one flag covers whatever the pipeline asks for next; the generated config is kept in `<outdir>/provenance/resource_limits.config`, so `commands.sh` replays the run under the same ceiling.

  Do **not** cap by naming processes (`withName: 'STAR_GENOMEGENERATE' { memory = '15.GB' }`) unless you mean to re-size that one step: `withName` changes a single process's *initial* request, so you must name every step that might exceed the host — miss one and the run dies there instead (`STAR_GENOMEGENERATE`, then `BBMAP_BBSPLIT`, then the next). It also does not cap the retry, which asks for more. Use `withName` (via `--config`) only to tune one specific step, e.g. giving a tool *less* than its label implies:
  ```groovy
  // tune-one-step.config
  process {
      withName: 'BBMAP_BBDUK' { memory = '12.GB' }
  }
  ```
  (Size any cap to the host *and* to what the tool actually needs — too low and the step itself fails or is OOM-killed.)

### Nextflow too new for an older release
- **Symptom:** `Unexpected input: ':'`, `Unexpected token`, `Invalid include source`, or `import ...` rejected — on Nextflow **26.04+**, whose default strict parser rejects older Groovy config syntax (typed declarations, functions with params, `manifest.*`/`validation.*` accessed at parse time, `import` in `.nf`). Many older releases hit this.
- **Fix:** Pin an engine the release was written for: `--nxf-ver 25.10.2` (must still satisfy the pipeline's declared `nextflowVersion` minimum). If you hit it on most pipelines, set it once for the shell: `export NXF_VER=25.10.2` (nfclaw passes it through). See [`compatibility.md`](compatibility.md).
  Confirmed-affected releases that **do** run with `--nxf-ver 25.10.2` include `epitopeprediction`, `hgtseq`, `callingcards`, `coproid`, `denovotranscript` 1.2.1, `chipseq` 2.1.0, `fastqrepair` 1.0.0, `atacseq` 2.1.2, `circdna` 1.1.0, `genomeassembler` 1.1.0, `detaxizer` 1.3.0, `cutandrun` 3.2.2 and `marsseq` 1.0.3 (newer releases such as `fetchngs` 1.13.0, `sarek` 3.10.0, and `scrnaseq` 4.2.0 declare `!>=25.10.4`, so use `--nxf-ver 25.10.4` to avoid Nextflow 26 strict parser failures on them).

  Examples of what NF 26 rejects:
  - chipseq's **and** marsseq's `def check_max(obj, type)` in `nextflow.config` (marsseq 1.0.3 declares only `!>=23.04.0`, so unpinned it parses under NF 26 and fails at launch with a `nextflow.cli.Launcher` error — `--nxf-ver 25.10.2` fixes it; note its `test` profile also sets `genome = 'mm10'`, which expects prebuilt local references; its configuration maps that key to GRCm39/M27, not AWS iGenomes).
  - scrnaseq 4.1.0's `Invalid include source: conf/test_multiome.config` (the `test_multiome` profile `includeConfig`s a file not committed at the tag — NF 26 validates it at parse time even though the profile is unused, while the legacy parser skips it and the `--demo` run completes).
  - cutandrun 3.2.2's `Cannot invoke method optional() on null object`, from deprecated output syntax `emit: html optional true` in `modules/local/for_patch/trimgalore/main.nf` (sibling modules already use current `emit: …, optional: true`).
- **Exception — some releases need a _newer_ engine:** `funcscan` 4.0.0 and `lsmquant` 1.0.2 declare `nextflowVersion = '!>=25.10.4'`, so `--nxf-ver 25.10.2` is rejected at the version gate (the symptom can read as a parameter/validation failure); use `--nxf-ver 25.10.4`. (`bactmap` 1.0.0 hits the parser issue *and* further bugs and can't run in demo here — see the upstream table).
- **In a chain (`nfclaw chain run`):** Pin the engine on that stage only — `"nxf_ver": "25.10.4"` in its spec entry — since other stages may need a newer one (fetchngs 1.13.0 requires `>=25.10.4`, mag 5.5.0 `>=26.04.0`). The chain parses every stage's config with its own engine (`nextflow config`) before the first stage launches, so this fails up front, not after the stages before it have run. Seen in chains on Nextflow 26.04.3: `atacseq` 2.1.2 (`def check_max`) and `viralrecon` 3.0.0 (`Invalid include source: conf/test_full_sispa.config`, a profile file missing at the pinned commit) — both parse with `"nxf_ver": "25.10.4"`.

### BUSCO finishes, then the task hangs until its time limit (IPv6-only host)
- **Symptom:** A `BUSCO_BUSCO` task (mag, and any pipeline running BUSCO 6) is killed at its time limit — Nextflow reports `process hasn't exited` — although its `.command.log` shows BUSCO's results and "Total running time: 6 seconds" hours earlier.
- **Why:** BUSCO 6 sends anonymous run statistics when it ends ("You may opt out with --opt-out-run-stats"); on a host without IPv4 that upload never completes, and the task waits on it.
- **Fix:** Opt out through a config given with `--config` (in a chain: the stage's `"config"`):
  ```groovy
  process {
      withName: 'BUSCO_BUSCO' {
          ext.args = { (params.busco_db ? '--offline ' : '') + '--opt-out-run-stats' }
      }
  }
  ```
  (mag's own `ext.args` is `--offline` when `--busco_db` is given; the closure preserves it.)

### Docker bridge network has no DNS (IPv6-only host)
- **Symptom:** Containers cannot resolve hostnames; downloads inside a container fail even though the host has connectivity. Docker's default bridge uses IPv4 DNS `8.8.8.8`, unreachable on an IPv6-only host.
- **Fix:** Give containers the host network via a config file passed with `--config`. `docker.runOptions` is a single string that a `--config` **replaces** (it does not merge with the pipeline's value), so preserve nf-core's default user mapping in the same string — otherwise the container reverts to running as root and outputs become root-owned:
  ```groovy
  // host-net.config — host network + nf-core's default user mapping
  docker { runOptions = "--network host -u $(id -u):$(id -g)" }
  ```
  Run with `nfclaw run <name> --config host-net.config …`.

### A container creates root-owned files that block publishing
- **Symptom:** A step writes a file/dir owned by root with restrictive permissions, and Nextflow — running as your user — cannot read or publish it. Examples: `CUSTOM_SRATOOLSNCBISETTINGS` and `macrel` (mode `600`), or STAR in `rnaseq` (`_STARgenome/` / `_STARpass1/` as `drwx------`, failing with `AccessDeniedException`).
- **Why:** nf-core's `docker` profile maps your host user into the container (`docker.runOptions = '-u $(id -u):$(id -g)'`). Any `--config` that sets `docker.runOptions` **replaces** this value rather than adding to it, causing containers to fall back to root.
- **Fix:** Keep the user mapping folded into the same `runOptions` string in your `--config`:
  ```groovy
  // run-as-user.config
  docker { runOptions = "-u $(id -u):$(id -g)" }
  ```
  If your shell trips over substitution (`syntax error near unexpected token ')'`), hardcode numeric ids (`id -u` / `id -g`): `docker { runOptions = "-u 1000:1000" }`.

### `--resume` resumed the wrong session
- **Status: Fixed.** `nfclaw run` launches Nextflow **from the `--outdir`**, so each run owns its own `.nextflow/` history and cache. `--resume` resumes *this* outdir's session — it can no longer pick up another pipeline's run. Always use a distinct `--outdir` per pipeline.

### `--resume` fails with "Unable to acquire lock on session …"
- **Symptom:** After a run was interrupted (killed/timed out), re-running with `--resume` fails to acquire the session lock.
- **Why:** A hard kill leaves Nextflow's session lock behind; Nextflow refuses to resume because it cannot determine whether the lock is stale or held by a live process.
- **Fix:** Ensure no Nextflow process for that `--outdir` is active, remove the stale lock under `<outdir>/.nextflow/cache/*/LOCK` (or start fresh in a new `--outdir`), and re-run with `--resume`.

### A run in the background: is it still going, and how did it end?
- **Symptom:** A run started with `nohup nfclaw run … &` — its `run.log` has no terminal line, or you need its outcome without opening the file.
- **Fix:** `nfclaw status <outdir>` answers from the log alone: `running (nfclaw pid … on host …)` with the last output; the outcome it ended with and the recorded error; `refused before launch`; or `stopped without an outcome`. Re-run the command with `--resume`. Stop a background run cleanly with `kill <nfclaw pid>` — never `kill -9` — so logs and provenance are finalized.

### Launching several pipelines in parallel
- **Status: Fixed.** Starting 2+ pipelines simultaneously whose submodules were uninitialised previously raced on `.git/config`. `nfclaw run` serializes submodule initialization with a per-repo file lock, ensuring concurrent first-time runs initialize submodules cleanly.

### Replaying a run: `provenance/commands.sh` reproduces into a *fresh* directory
- **Status: Fixed.** The replay script reproduces the run into a **fresh** directory, defaulting to `<outdir>.replay`:
  ```bash
  ./results/provenance/commands.sh                 # → results.replay/
  ./results/provenance/commands.sh /tmp/check-it   # or name the target yourself
  ```
  It refuses a target that already holds files, launches Nextflow from the target directory, and passes `--outdir "$target"`.

  Stop it with `kill <replay pid>`. New bundles run the command in its own process
  group, allow ten seconds for shutdown, then kill surviving group members before
  closing the log and releasing the writer lock. A stopped replay returns a
  nonzero exit status even if the command handles the signal with exit zero.
  Tasks or containers detached from that group still require executor cleanup.

### `--check` never writes into `--outdir`
- **Status: Fixed.** `--check` validates parameters and prints the command without launching, staging parameters in a temporary directory and leaving `--outdir` untouched.

### A replay can change bytes and timestamped metadata filenames
Some outputs embed dates or durations: execution reports, timelines, gzip headers,
FastQC ZIP entries and MultiQC HTML can differ between runs. A changed checksum
does not identify the cause; inspect scientific results with a format-aware comparison.
Matching file inventories alone does not establish analytical agreement. Check both with:
```bash
nfclaw verify results.replay --against results
```
It hashes the replay's live files and compares them with the original recorded checksums
**by path**, reporting `identical` / `changed` / `missing` / `extra`. Missing or extra
files fail the structural check; add `--strict` to fail on any changed bytes as well.

nfclaw pins the schema's `trace_report_suffix` where available, but some upstream
code generates other filenames directly from the clock. For example, demo 1.2.0's
`dumpParametersToJSON()` independently names `pipeline_info/params_<timestamp>.json`.
Its replay produces a missing/extra metadata pair even when the analysis outputs
match. A resumed run can also retain reports from earlier attempts. Classify these
differences explicitly; do not erase metadata or treat all missing/extra files as
proof that the analysis changed. The upstream tree is preserved, and the verifier
reports the actual inventory without silently excluding these files.

**Do not diff the two `outputs.sha256` files directly.** Each line is `hash  path`, so a file whose
content merely changed has a different line in each bundle and shows up as *both* "missing" and
"extra" — one changed report is counted twice, and a run whose reports simply carry a new timestamp
reads as hundreds of missing and extra files. That is an artefact of the comparison, not a defect in
the replay; `nfclaw verify` keys on the path precisely to separate the two questions.

### Chains: `[handoff_failed]` — the next stage's input could not be prepared
- **Symptom:** `nfclaw chain run` stops after a stage succeeded, with `[handoff_failed]` and the chain log ending `failed at stage NN-<stage>: handoff`.
- **Why:** The handoff rule expected an output the upstream run did not produce (or produced multiple matching files), or the generated samplesheet failed downstream schema checks.
- **Fix:** Inspect the snapshot in `<outdir>/chain/handoffs/`; provide parameters directly in stage `params`, supply an inline handoff, and resume: `nfclaw chain run spec.json --outdir DIR --resume`.

### Concurrency: `another nfclaw run is active in …`
- **Symptom:** `nfclaw run` aborts immediately with `[environment] another nfclaw run is active in <outdir>`.
- **Why:** To prevent session corruption, `runner/locking.py` holds an exclusive non-blocking sibling flock on `.{outdir.name}.nfclaw.lock` throughout workflow execution.
- **Fix:** Wait for the active run to finish (`nfclaw status <outdir>`) or terminate it (`kill <pid>`) before launching or resuming in that directory.

### Chains: `another nfclaw chain is running in …`
- **Symptom:** `nfclaw chain` aborts indicating another chain process is running.
- **Why:** Only one chain process is permitted per `--outdir` to prevent race conditions on shared stage state (`chain/.lock`).
- **Fix:** Wait for the active chain to complete (`tail -n 1 <outdir>/chain/logs/chain.log`) or stop it with `kill <pid>`.

### Replay dependency guard failures (`provenance/replay_guard.py`)
- **Symptom:** Running `<outdir>/provenance/commands.sh` aborts with `nfclaw replay: dependency check failed: ...` before Nextflow is launched.
- **Why:** `commands.sh` executes `replay_guard.py` to ensure local input files (including paths referenced in samplesheets), external Nextflow configs (`-c`), and tracked pipeline source commits match their recorded SHA-256 manifests.
- **Fix:** Restore the original input files or external configs to match the recorded checksums in `<outdir>/provenance/inputs.sha256` and `configs.sha256`. If intentional changes were made, launch a new run into a new `--outdir` instead of replaying.

### Replay refuses an unobserved engine or malformed environment names
- **Why:** New bundles pin replays to the engine version observed in the executed
  Nextflow banner, even when the original environment selected `latest` or another
  moving selector. If no version was observed and no concrete `NXF_VER` was set,
  the bundle cannot select that engine faithfully. Environment names that cannot
  be represented as shell identifiers are also refused.
- **Fix:** Start a fresh run with a valid environment and an explicit `--nxf-ver`
  from the pinned pipeline's documented engine requirement. Do not guess which
  engine an earlier unobserved run used. Private URI credentials are omitted from
  exported replay values; supply any needed credentials through your environment.

## Warnings a run prints that are not faults

These messages originate in upstream configurations, plugins or tools. Some have
been observed during successful runs, but a warning or an exit-zero process alone
does not establish analytical correctness. Interpret each message in the context
of its documented version and cause. A replay can reproduce the same message;
cache, network and environment changes can also change what it prints.

### `WARN: Unrecognized config option 'validation.defaultIgnoreParams'` / `'validation.monochromeLogs'`
- **Cause:** Running a Nextflow engine *newer* than the release targets. Harmless and avoidable.

  | Nextflow Version | Output / Result |
  |---|---|
  | **25.10.4** (declared minimum `!>=25.10.4`) | **No warnings emitted** |
  | **26.04.6** | `WARN: Unrecognized config option 'validation.defaultIgnoreParams'` + `'validation.monochromeLogs'` |

  Both options are set by the pipeline's own `nextflow.config` inside the `validation` scope contributed by `nf-schema`. Nextflow 26's strict parser checks config options before plugins load; because nf-schema registers no `ConfigScope` for `validation`, the parser warns. Tracked upstream in [nextflow-io/nf-schema#117](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-schema/issues/117).
- **Fix:** Run the engine the release was authored for:
  ```bash
  nfclaw run scrnaseq --input ss.csv --outdir results -profile docker --nxf-ver 25.10.4
  ```

### `WARN: Could not load / include the nf-core institutional config` (a host without network access)
- **Cause:** Nextflow could not fetch nf-core's optional remote institutional configuration from GitHub at parse time. sarek 3.10.0 (and 3.9.0) includes it dynamically in `nextflow.config` (line 322):
  ```groovy
  includeConfig params.custom_config_base && (!System.getenv('NXF_OFFLINE') || !params.custom_config_base.startsWith('http'))
      ? "${params.custom_config_base}/nfcore_custom.config" : "/dev/null"
  ```
  On air-gapped or IPv6-only hosts unable to reach GitHub, the remote file cannot be resolved. The configuration is purely optional tuning.
- **Fix:** Set `NXF_OFFLINE=true` to skip remote includes cleanly:
  ```bash
  nfclaw run sarek --input ss.csv --outdir results -profile docker --nxf-env NXF_OFFLINE=true
  ```

### `WARN: The following invalid input values have been detected: * --igenomes_base: …` (an institutional profile)
- **Cause:** Set by an institutional profile, not by the pipeline or nf-claw. For example, `binac2.config` sets `params.igenomes_base` for all pipelines; pipelines that do not resolve reference genomes (such as `fetchngs`) do not declare this parameter, causing nf-schema to flag it. It is benign and does not affect analysis.

### `ERROR org.pf4j.AbstractExtensionFinder - Different class loaders`
- **Cause:** A plugin-cache artifact on the host where pf4j discovers the same extension point loaded by two class loaders.
- **Fix:** Clear the plugin cache and re-pin the declared engine:
  ```bash
  rm -rf "${NXF_HOME:-$HOME/.nextflow}/plugins"
  ```

### `WARN: nf-core pipelines do not accept positional arguments. The positional argument \`nextflow\` has been detected.`
- **Cause:** A known defect in the pinned `nf-core-utils@0.4.0` plugin used by sarek 3.10.0 (and 3.9.0). The plugin's validator splits `session.commandLine` on whitespace and incorrectly inspects the launcher binary name `nextflow`. It is benign (`log.warn`, exit 0) and does not affect execution.

### `WARN: --validationSchemaIgnoreParams: genomes` is not a valid parameter (scrnaseq `--demo`)
- **Cause:** An upstream defect in `nf-core/scrnaseq` 4.2.0 test configurations referencing obsolete nf-validation 1.x parameters.
- **nf-claw Mitigation:** `nfclaw run` automatically neutralizes this warning by generating a narrow `-c` compatibility configuration:
  ```groovy
  // <outdir>/provenance/nf_schema_compat.config
  validation { ignoreParams = ['validationSchemaIgnoreParams'] }
  ```
  Pipelines declaring nf-validation 1.x correctly (e.g. `chipseq`, `atacseq`, `circdna`) are untouched.

### rnaseq `--demo`: `--gtf` with `--gff`, `--transcript_fasta`, and the `first` operator
- **Cause:** rnaseq's bundled `conf/test.config` intentionally sets `gtf`, `gff`, and `transcript_fasta` simultaneously to exercise multiple code paths, prompting Nextflow to log preference for `--gtf`. A real production run specifying custom references does not set both and emits no warning.

## Upstream pipeline bugs (documented, not patched)

These are defects in specific pinned releases. Workarounds are implemented via CLI flags and configurations without modifying upstream code:

| Pipeline @ Version | Symptom | Underlying Defect | Recommended Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bamtofastq` (incl. 2.1.2 / 2.2.1) | `SAMTOOLS_FAIDX ([])` fails immediately | The `test` profile sets `genome = null` + `igenomes_ignore = true`, routing an empty dummy channel into `SAMTOOLS_FAIDX`. | Provide an explicit reference (`--fasta` / `--genome`); demo mode without reference fails upstream. |
| `bacass` 2.6.1 (Unicycler) | `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\d'` then fails on Python 3.12 | The `unicycler:0.5.1` container ships legacy Python code not updated for Python 3.12. | Select Megahit assembler: `--assembler megahit`. |
| `hgtseq` 1.1.0 | `a column named input1 ... is mandatory!` | Schema requires `sample,fastq_1[,fastq_2]`, but custom parser `workflows/hgtseq.nf` expects `sample,input1[,input2]`. | Supply a samplesheet matching `sample,input1[,input2]` using `--input`; avoid relying on `--demo`. |
| `funcscan` 2.1.0 – 4.0.0 (DRAMP DB only) | `TypeError` in `ampcombi_download.py` when downloading DRAMP database | DRAMP download loop regex matches NaN float values when rows contain empty sequence fields. APD database unaffected. (Requires `--nxf-ver 25.10.4`). | Pre-build DRAMP database with NaN rows removed and pass `--amp_ampcombi_db /path/to/db`. |
| `taxprofiler` 2.x (MultiQC 1.34) | `MULTIQC` fails: `AttributeError: module 'rich' has no attribute 'panel'` | MultiQC raises `IndexError` on empty MetaPhlAn profiles, followed by a secondary failure in error reporting. | Profile reads that match database content, or disable MetaPhlAn: `--run_metaphlan false`. |
| `bactmap` 1.0.0 | bundled `--demo` reference cannot be read; its default preview also cannot complete | The moving test-data branch deleted the original *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* reference and now supplies *Bacteroides fragilis* reads. The `test` profile also replaces the module-options map, dropping defaults such as MultiQC arguments. With those two faults addressed, the unconditional completion handler still waits on `multiqc_report.getVal()`, which has no value under `-preview`. | Use the complete matched historical [test-data snapshot](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/02195cfa96ca496173e9d63dd58e34bf02fcf55a), retain the bundled default module options and reapply the test overrides. A genuine Docker test run on Nextflow 24.10.5 completed all 47 tasks; all four trees contained the expected three samples and reference. This establishes execution and output identity, not phylogenetic accuracy. The default preview remains rejected. |
| `createpanelrefs`, `proteinfamilies` (pinned releases) | default `-preview` acceptance times out | Nextflow's workflow-output completion code waits for values that preview never produces; this was reproduced on the declared 26.04.0 engine and 26.04.6. | A preview-only config with `workflow.output.enabled=false` permits createpanelrefs graph validation. For proteinfamilies, set the bundled `params.skip_proteinfold_samplesheet=true` and `params.skip_proteinannotator_samplesheet=true` as Groovy booleans in a config. Both variants completed, but output publishing is excluded from their validation. Keep their default previews rejected and validate actual analysis and publishing before scientific use. |
| `multiplesequencealign` 1.1.1 | default `-preview` acceptance times out | Its own completion handler waits on `summary_reports.getVal()`; preview cannot produce the required process results. A newer engine does not resolve this dependency. | The unchanged official `test_tiny,docker` profile completed all 78 tasks on the declared Nextflow 25.04.2, using a matched immutable test-data snapshot. FAMSA, MAFFT and consensus outputs preserved all sequence IDs and ungapped amino-acid sequences; all six summary rows had finite configured metrics. This covers the tiny profile's two aligners and completion lifecycle, not every aligner or biological alignment accuracy. The default preview remains rejected. |
| `marsseq` 1.0.3 | bundled `test` analysis preview fails with missing local references | `test.config` selects `mm10`, but analysis requires prebuilt FASTA, GTF, Bowtie2 and STAR references. `main.nf` chooses either reference building or analysis, so build and analysis are separate invocations. | Build with `--build-references true --velocity true` so both Bowtie2 and STAR indexes are generated (analysis checks the STAR path even when velocity is disabled), then supply the resulting reference base using `--genomes-base`. The complete bundled reference workflow, including real Bowtie2 and STAR indexes, completed on Nextflow 23.04.0; default and velocity-enabled analysis previews then passed with matched SB26-AB339 test inputs. These previews do not execute quantification or establish expression accuracy. **Assembly warning:** the [pinned `mm10` key](https://github.com/nf-core/marsseq/blob/b02ede773092f8a8a5999400acda6894d51b4d26/conf/genomes.config) selects **GRCm39 / GENCODE M27**, plus ERCC sequences; [GENCODE identifies M27 as GRCm39](https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_M27.html), whereas [UCSC mm10 is GRCm38](https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/gbdb/mm10/html/description.html). Record the actual assembly, annotation and reference checksums; never silently substitute GRCm38 or infer the assembly from this key. |
| `tumourevo` 1.0.0 | CNAqc parameter description links to an absent parameter | The pinned schema's `cnaqc_min_absolute_karyotype_mutations` description refers to `cnaqc_min_karyotype_size`, which is not declared in that schema or passed by its CNAqc module configuration. This upstream cross-reference has no target in the generated documentation. | Use only parameters declared by the pinned schema; nfclaw rejects the absent flag. `--cnaqc-min-absolute-karyotype-mutations` sets an absolute mutation-count threshold. The missing reference does not establish an equivalent relative threshold or a replacement flag; consult the pinned module and CNAqc tool documentation for interpretation. |

## Pipeline-specific run notes

- **`demo` 1.2.0 on macOS arm64 with amd64 containers** — MultiQC 1.34 can
  return exit zero and write its HTML/data while Kaleido/Chromium fails to export
  plots under QEMU. Fresh and resumed local runs both reported `0/36 completed`,
  with `qemu: unknown option 'type=utility'` and Chromium sandbox/GPU crashes.
  Check the task's `.command.err` and required plot files even when pipeline status
  is success. Validate required exports on a compatible native execution platform;
  no arm64 image or emulation workaround has been established yet.

- **`fetchngs`** — If accessions lack ENA FTP links, the pipeline falls back to `SRATOOLS_PREFETCH` (requiring NCBI SRA Cloud access). In network-restricted environments, run metadata-only via `--skip_fastq_download`. (Accepts `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.txt` accession lists at pinned 1.13.0 and `dev`).
- **`coproid`** — Requires **two** samplesheets: `--input` (FASTQ sheet) and a separate required `--genome_sheet`. Each row in `--genome_sheet` requires `genome_name,taxid,genome_size` plus **exactly one** of `igenome` or `fasta` (mutually exclusive `oneOf` schema). `--kraken2_db` is mandatory and must point to a valid Kraken2 database.
- **`crisprseq`** — The samplesheet `reference` column expects a **raw DNA sequence string** (pattern `^[ACTGNactgn]+$`), not a FASTA file path.
- **`circdna`** — Two parameters are **required by schema** for non-demo runs: `--input_format` (`FASTQ` or `BAM`) and `--circle_identifier` (one or more of `circle_map_realign`, `circle_map_repeats`, `circle_finder`, `circexplorer2`, `ampliconarchitect`).
- **`metapep`** — The `--demo` profile runs `DOWNLOAD_PROTEINS`, which fetches sequences from **NCBI Entrez** (`download_proteins_entrez.py --email $NCBI_EMAIL`) reading a Nextflow secret named `NCBI_EMAIL`. Set the secret prior to execution: `nextflow secrets set NCBI_EMAIL you@example.com`.
- **`createtaxdb`** — Assign each sample a **non-numeric** `id` (e.g. `seq1`, `chr1`). Purely numeric strings (`"1"`) are coerced to integers by nf-schema, violating string constraints.
- **`genomeassembler`** — Set at least one of `--ont true` or `--hifi true` (the pipeline aborts with `At least one of params.ont, params.hifi needs to be true.`).
- **`funcscan`** — Pin `--nxf-ver 25.10.4` (declares `!>=25.10.4`). Demo profiles run all three screenings (AMP, ARG, CAZyme), which download multi-gigabyte models; pre-supply databases via `--amp_ampcombi_db` or disable heavy steps via `--run_cazyme_screening false` and `--arg_skip_deeparg true`.
- **`sarek` 3.10.0 (`sarek` 3.9.0)** — Upstream examples for cache/index-only runs show `--build_only_index --input false`. In raw Nextflow, this causes an nf-schema validation error because `input` is declared as a string path. In `nfclaw run sarek --input false`, nfclaw intercepts `--input false` and leaves `input` unset in `params.json`, allowing index-only runs (`--build_only_index true --download_cache true`) to succeed cleanly without schema errors. For raw Nextflow runs, omit `--input` instead of passing `false`.
- **`sarek` 3.10.0 (`sarek` 3.9.0)** — Do not use `--config pipelines/sarek/upstream/conf/test.config` to convert an analysis run into a test run with a custom samplesheet. Extra configs load after initial profile setup, causing validation of default S3 iGenomes paths. Run with `-profile test,docker` instead: `nfclaw run sarek --input samplesheet_sarek.csv --outdir results -profile test,docker`. For bundled test data, use `nfclaw run sarek --demo --outdir results`.
- **`ampliseq`** — The `test` profile caps memory at 6 GB; export steps (e.g. `QIIME2_EXPORT_RELTAX`) may be OOM-killed (exit 137). In production, raise limits with `--max_memory '<N>.GB'` or `--limit-memory`.

### Chains: what a `demo: true` stage hands over

When a stage specifies `demo: true`, it executes with its bundled test profile dataset:
- **`detaxizer`:** The test profile filters reads with an empty database, removing all reads and leaving empty FastQ files. For downstream chaining, provide active classification parameters: `"params": {"classification_kraken2": false, "classification_bbduk": true, "fasta_bbduk": "<host fasta>"}`.
- **`demultiplex`:** Test data consists of human amplicon reads. Downstream stages requiring reference genomes need human references (`fasta`/`gtf`), and paired-end profiles: `"profile": "test_pe,docker"`.
- **`taxprofiler`:** Test profiling on unrecognized reads fails in unhandled zero-hit modules; enable only resilient profilers (`run_kraken2`, `run_kaiju`) with `"run_profile_standardisation": false`.
