# pathogensurveillance — full parameter reference

nf-core/pathogensurveillance pipeline parameters. Every parameter from the pinned `nextflow_schema.json`, validated by nf-schema at runtime. `hidden` marks nf-core's generic/boilerplate parameters; `constraints` lists each parameter's declared value bounds (pattern, min/max, length) — conditional or composed rules (e.g. anyOf/oneOf) are enforced by nf-schema at runtime.

## analysis_parameters

| parameter | type | required | hidden | allowed values | constraints | default | description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--allow-atypical-refs` | boolean |  |  |  |  | false | When selecting references automatically, allow assemblies that NCBI considers atypical. |
| `--allow-non-refseq` | boolean |  |  |  |  | false | When selecting references automatically, allow assemblies not in RefSeq. |
| `--allow-unannotated` | boolean |  |  |  |  | false | When selecting references automatically, allow assemblies that do not have annotations. The pipeline will attempt to annotate these references as needed. |
| `--cpu-scale` | number |  |  |  | ≥ 0.01 | 1.0 | A scaling factor to adjust the number of CPUs used by multithreaded processes. The number of CPUs for each process will be multiplied by this value and rounded to the nearest integer (minimum 1). |
| `--max-depth` | number |  |  |  |  | 100 | Maximum depth of reads to be used for all analyses. Samples with more reads are subsampled to this depth. |
| `--max-samples` | integer |  |  |  |  | 1000 | Maximum number of samples to analyze. The first n samples will be used. |
| `--max-variants` | number |  |  |  |  | 100000 | The maximum number of variants to use for the SNP tree and minimum spanning nextwork produced by the variant analysis. The first N variants are used when more than N are available. |
| `--min-bases-to-assemble` | number |  |  |  |  | 100000 | The minimum number of bases after quality filtering needed to attempt an genome assembly. Samples with few than this amount of bases will be excluded from further analysis. |
| `--n-ref-closest` | number |  |  |  |  | 2 | The number of references most similar to each sample based on estimated ANI to include in phyogenetic anlyses. |
| `--n-ref-closest-named` | number |  |  |  |  | 1 | Same as the 'n_ref_closest' option except that it only applies to referneces with what apppear to be standard latin binomaial names (i.e. two words with no numbers or symbols). This is intended to ensure that a refernece with an informative name is present even if it is not the most similar. |
| `--n-ref-context` | number |  |  |  |  | 5 | The number of references representing the entire range of ANI relative to each sample. These are meant to provide context for more similar references. For a group of samples, the fewest total references will be selected that satisify this count for each sample. |
| `--n-ref-genera` | integer or string |  |  |  |  | 20 | The maximum number/percentage of references representing unique genera to download from RefSeq for each family predicited to be in each sample. Samples with similar initial indentifications will usually use the same references, so the total number of references downloaded for a goup of samples will depend on the taxonomic diversity of the samples. |
| `--n-ref-species` | integer or string |  |  |  |  | 20 | The maximum number/percentage of references representing unique species to download from RefSeq for each genus predicited to be in each sample. Samples with similar initial indentifications will usually use the same references, so the total number of references downloaded for a goup of samples will depend on the taxonomic diversity of the samples. |
| `--n-ref-strains` | integer or string |  |  |  |  | 5 | The maximum number/percentage of references representing unique subspecies to download from RefSeq for each species predicited to be in each sample. Samples with similar initial indentifications will usually use the same references, so the total number of references downloaded for a goup of samples will depend on the taxonomic diversity of the samples. |
| `--only-latin-binomial-refs` | boolean |  |  |  |  | false | When selecting references automatically, only consider references with names that appear to be standard latin bionomials (i.e. no numbers or symbols in the first two words). |
| `--phylo-max-genes` | number |  |  |  |  | 500 | The maximum number of genes used to conduct a core gene phylogeny. |
| `--phylo-min-genes` | number |  |  |  |  | 10 | The minimum number of genes needed to conduct a core gene phylogeny. Samples and references will be removed (as allowed by the `min_core_samps` and `min_core_refs` options) until this minimum is met. |
| `--ref-min-ani` | number |  |  |  | ≥ 0; ≤ 1 | 0.95 | The minimum ANI between a sample and potential reference for that reference to be used for mapping reads from that sample. To force all the samples in a report group to use the same reference, set this value very low. |
| `--skip-core-phylogeny` | boolean |  |  |  |  | false | Skip the core genome phylogeny analysis. This will not affect downstream processes like MultiQC and the main report. |
