# metaboigniter — full parameter reference

nf-core/metaboigniter pipeline parameters. Every parameter from the pinned `nextflow_schema.json`, validated by nf-schema at runtime. `hidden` marks nf-core's generic/boilerplate parameters; `constraints` lists each parameter's declared value bounds (pattern, min/max, length) — conditional or composed rules (e.g. anyOf/oneOf) are enforced by nf-schema at runtime.

| `--algorithm-superimposer-scaling-bucket-size-mapalignerposeclustering-openms` | number |  | yes |  |  | 0.005 | The scaling of the retention time interval is being hashed into buckets of this size during pose clustering. A good choice for this would be a bit smaller than the error you would expect from repeated runs. |

Two signals from different maps will not be connected by an edge in the compatibility graph if absolute log fold change exceeds this limit (they might still end up in the same connected component, however). Note: this does not limit fold changes in the linking stage, only during RT alignment, where we try to find high-quality alignment anchor points. Setting this to a value < 0 disables the FC check. |

'constant': Use the constant value of the B-spline at the corresponding endpoint.

| `--model-b-spline-num-nodes-maprttransformer-openms` | integer |  | yes |  |  |  | Number of nodes for B-spline fitting. Overrides 'wavelength' if set (to two or greater). A lower value means more smoothing. |
| `--model-b-spline-wavelength-maprttransformer-openms` | number |  | yes |  |  |  | Determines the amount of smoothing by setting the number of nodes for the B-spline. The number is chosen so that the spline approximates a low-pass filter with this cutoff wavelength. The wavelength is given in the same units as the data; a higher value means more smoothing.

E.g., for 'charge_max' 4 and 'max_minority_bound' 2 with most probable adduct being H+ and least probable adduct being Na+, this will allow adduct compositions of '2(H+),2(Na+)' but not of '1(H+),3(Na+)'.

| `--algorithm-signaltonoise-max-intensity-peakpickerhires-openms` | integer |  | yes |  |  |  | maximal intensity considered for histogram construction. By default, it will be calculated automatically (see auto_mode). Only provide this parameter if you know what you are doing (and change 'auto_mode' to '-1')! All intensities EQUAL/ABOVE 'max_intensity' will be added to the LAST histogram bin. If you choose 'max_intensity' too small, the noise estimate might be too small as well. If chosen too big, the bins become quite large (which you could counter by increasing 'bin_count', which increases runtime). In general, the Median-S/N estimator is more robust to a manual max_intensity than the MeanIterative-S/N. |
| `--algorithm-signaltonoise-min-required-elements-peakpickerhires-openms` | integer |  | yes |  |  |  | minimum number of elements required in a window (otherwise it is considered sparse) |

| `--algorithm-spacing-difference-gap-peakpickerhires-openms` | number |  | yes |  |  |  | The extension of a peak is stopped if the spacing between two subsequent data points exceeds 'spacing_difference_gap * min_spacing'. 'min_spacing' is the smaller of the two spacings from the peak apex to its two neighboring points. '0' to disable the constraint. Not applicable to chromatograms. |
| `--algorithm-spacing-difference-peakpickerhires-openms` | number |  | yes |  |  |  | Maximum allowed difference between points during peak extension, in multiples of the minimal difference between the peak apex and its two neighboring points. If this difference is exceeded a missing point is assumed (see parameter 'missing'). A higher value implies a less stringent peak definition, since individual signals within the peak are allowed to be further apart. '0' to disable the constraint. Not applicable to chromatograms. |
