description: Pipeline for the identification of circular DNAs
summary: nf-core/circdna is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for the identification of extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) in eukaryotic cells. The pipeline is able to process WGS, ATAC-seq data or Circle-Seq data generated from short-read sequencing technologies. Depending on the input data and selected analysis branch, nf-core/circdna is able to identify various types of ecDNAs. This includes the detection of smaller ecDNAs, often referred to as eccDNAs or microDNAs, as well as larger ecDNAs that exhibit amplification. These analyses are facilitated through the use of prominent software tools that are widely recognized in the field of ecDNA or circular DNA research.

# circdna

nf-core/circdna is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for the identification of extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) in eukaryotic cells. The pipeline is able to process WGS, ATAC-seq data or Circle-Seq data generated from short-read sequencing technologies. Depending on the input data and selected analysis branch, nf-core/circdna is able to identify various types of ecDNAs. This includes the detection of smaller ecDNAs, often referred to as eccDNAs or microDNAs, as well as larger ecDNAs that exhibit amplification. These analyses are facilitated through the use of prominent software tools that are widely recognized in the field of ecDNA or circular DNA research.

## Run it
```bash
git submodule update --init pipelines/circdna/upstream   # first time only
nfclaw run circdna --input samplesheet.csv --outdir results --input-format <input_format> --circle-identifier <circle_identifier> -profile docker
# raw equivalent (the submodule is already pinned to this release, so no -r is needed):
nextflow run pipelines/circdna/upstream -profile docker --input samplesheet.csv --outdir results --input-format <input_format> --circle-identifier <circle_identifier>
```

This is the pinned latest release. To run a different one, list the available releases with `nfclaw versions circdna` and add `--pipeline-version X.Y.Z` to the command above (`nfclaw show circdna --pipeline-version X.Y.Z` prints that release's docs).

## Inputs
| column | type | required | allowed values | constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sample` | string | yes |  | matches ^\S+$ |
| `fastq_1` | string | yes |  | matches ^\S+\.f(ast)?q\.gz$ |
| `fastq_2` | string | no |  |  |

`--input` must match `^\S+\.csv$`.

The samplesheet is a CSV with this header (the columns the schema requires); fill each value per the table above and `reference.md` (no example value is invented here):
```csv
sample,fastq_1
```

Any of the optional columns above may be appended to the header when your data needs them: `fastq_2`.

## Required parameters
| parameter | type | default | allowed values | constraints | description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--input` | string (file path) |  |  | matches ^\S+\.csv$ | Path to comma-separated file containing information about the samples in the experiment. |
| `--input-format` | string |  |  |  | Specify input format. Default *FASTQ*. Options 'FASTQ' or 'BAM'. |
| `--outdir` | string (directory path) |  |  |  | The output directory where the results will be saved. You have to use absolute paths to storage on Cloud infrastructure. |
| `--circle-identifier` | string |  |  |  | Specifies the circular DNA identification algorithm to use - available 'circle_map_realign', 'circle_map_repeats', 'circle_finder', 'circexplorer2', and 'ampliconarchitect'. Multiple circle_identifier's can be specified with a comma-separated string. E.g. `--circle_identifier 'circle_map_realign,unicycler'`. |

## Other parameters
Every parameter not listed above is optional as far as the schema is concerned. [reference.md](reference.md) documents them all — type, default, allowed values and constraints — organised into these groups (counts are full group sizes, so they include any parameter already listed above):
- **ampliconarchitect options** (`amplicon_architect_options`) — 5 parameters
- **Circular DNA identifier options** (`circdna_identifier_options`) — 1 parameter
- **Circle_finder options** (`circle_finder_options`) — 1 parameter
- **circle-map options** (`circle_map_options`) — 1 parameter
- **Generic options** (`generic_options`) — 15 parameters
- **Input/output options** (`input_output_options`) — 7 parameters
- **Institutional config options** (`institutional_config_options`) — 6 parameters
- **Max job request options** (`max_job_request_options`) — 3 parameters
- **Process Skipping options** (`process_skipping_options`) — 5 parameters
- **Read trimming options** (`read_trimming_options`) — 8 parameters
- **Reference genome options** (`reference_genome_options`) — 5 parameters
- **Unicycler options** (`unicycler_options`) — 1 parameter

## Resources
A real (non-`--demo`) run requests the resources the pipeline's `conf/base.config` asks for, which are sized for a server — a single step can request far more memory than a workstation has, and Nextflow retries a failed step with more still. If a run fails with `Process requirement exceeds available memory` (or CPUs), cap every request, and every retry, at what this machine actually has:

```bash
nfclaw run circdna --input samplesheet.csv --outdir results -profile docker \
  --limit-cpus 4 --limit-memory 15.GB --limit-time 1.h
```

nfclaw turns those into Nextflow's `process.resourceLimits` and passes them as a `-c` config — the mechanism nf-core prescribes for exactly this ([docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#set-max-resources)). Set them to the machine's real capacity. The generated config is kept in `<outdir>/provenance/`, so `commands.sh` replays the run under the same ceiling.

## Nextflow engine
This release declares `nextflowVersion = '!>=23.04.0'`.

To run the engine this release targets — worth doing if a newer Nextflow emits config-parser warnings the release never saw:
```bash
nfclaw run circdna ... --nxf-ver 23.04.0
```
`--nxf-ver` is recorded in `<outdir>/provenance/`, so the replay uses the same engine. See [known-issues](../../docs/known-issues.md).

## Outputs
Results land in `--outdir`, organised into one sub-directory per pipeline step/module; standardized run metadata in `<outdir>/pipeline_info/` (execution report, software versions). A MultiQC HTML report aggregates QC across steps. `nfclaw run` also writes `<outdir>/provenance/` with the exact params file and run logs; unless `--no-provenance` it adds a run manifest (pinned version, commit and exact command), input/output SHA-256 checksums, and a replayable `commands.sh`.

The exact output files and directory layout for this release are documented upstream: https://github.com/nf-core/circdna/blob/1.1.0/docs/output.md

## Demo
```bash
nfclaw run circdna --demo --outdir results   # adds the upstream test profile (-profile test,docker)
```

## Full reference
Every parameter — name, type, required, hidden, allowed values, constraints, default and description — is in [reference.md](reference.md). Use it as the source of truth; do not guess flags. Nextflow's nf-schema validates every parameter against this schema at runtime, so an unknown or invalid value fails fast. Upstream usage: https://github.com/nf-core/circdna/blob/1.1.0/docs/usage.md
