# nf-claw — nf-core pipelines for agents

This repo is a library of nf-core pipelines. Each lives in `pipelines/<name>/`:
`upstream/` (the pinned pipeline code, a git submodule) and `skill.md` (how to run it).

---

## Setup (first time)

Install once, from the repo root, so the `nfclaw` command is on PATH:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
(Use a virtualenv on a space-free path; on macOS also avoid iCloud paths).

**No-install equivalent:** run `python3 -m runner <cmd>` from the repo root anywhere this doc shows `nfclaw <cmd>`.

---

## To run a pipeline

1. **Find it:** grep `catalog.json` (or `catalog.md`) for a keyword — do NOT read it whole.
2. **Read `pipelines/<name>/skill.md`:** the exact command, inputs, and required parameters for the pinned version.
3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   nfclaw run <name> --input samplesheet.csv --outdir results -profile docker
   ```
   *(Raw fallback: `nextflow run pipelines/<name>/upstream -profile docker ...` — the submodule is already pinned to the release, so no `-r`)*.
4. **Check status (foreground or background):**
   ```bash
   nfclaw status results
   ```
   Prints `success`, `running`, or how it ended with the error (exit codes: `0` success, `3` running, `1` failed). Logs: see [Where a run is logged](#where-a-run-is-logged--and-how-to-check-one).

> [!NOTE]
> `nfclaw run` executes the pipeline for real — there is no preview/dry-run default. To see the exact `nextflow` command that *would* run without launching it, add `--check` (it validates inputs and parameters, prints the command — prefixed with the `NXF_*` variables `--nxf-ver`/`--nxf-env` set for it, e.g. `NXF_VER=25.10.4 nextflow run …` — and exits; it writes nothing into `--outdir`, so you can still use that directory for the real run). Add `--demo` to run the pinned release's bundled test profile end to end. A run has no overall time limit unless you pass `--timeout SECONDS`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Run Concurrency Locking:** On POSIX systems, `nfclaw run` holds an exclusive non-blocking sibling lock (`.{outdir.name}.nfclaw.lock`) around the run. Overlapping or concurrent runs into the same `--outdir` fail fast with an environment error, preventing race conditions or output corruption.

> [!TIP]
> **Absolute Paths in Samplesheets:** Write **absolute paths inside a samplesheet**: Nextflow resolves them against its launch directory, which `nfclaw run` sets to `--outdir`, so a relative one cannot mean what it says — `nfclaw run` rejects it before launching. `--input` itself may be relative (nfclaw makes it absolute), and it is not always a samplesheet: the pipeline's schema decides — a directory or tarball (rangeland), an SDRF file or PRIDE accession (mhcquant), or `--input false` where a pipeline documents running without one (sarek — nfclaw intercepts it and leaves `input` unset in the params file, avoiding nf-schema type errors). The `Inputs` section of `skill.md` says which.

---

## Where a run is logged — and how to check one

Every `nfclaw run` records itself at a fixed place — there is no need to redirect its output, and nothing to look up. To know how a run stands, ask nfclaw:

```bash
nfclaw status <outdir>
```

Prints `status: success`, `running (…)`, the outcome it ended with (`failed (exit status N)`, `timed out after N s`, `interrupted`, `terminated by SIGTERM`, `refused before launch`), or `stopped without an outcome` (nfclaw itself was killed with SIGKILL, ran out of memory, or the machine restarted); then the log, and the recorded error or the run's last output. Exit code: 0 success, 3 running, 1 anything else. It works for replays too.

### Log Files Overview

- **`<outdir>/provenance/logs/run.log`** — The whole launch in order: nfclaw's header (command, launch directory, Nextflow log path, host and pids, advisories), everything Nextflow printed, and on failure nfclaw's error. Child-output lines are prefixed with `| ` so printed text cannot forge nfclaw's status markers; `nfclaw status` removes that prefix when displaying the output, and `stdout.txt` / `stderr.txt` preserve the raw run streams. Once nfclaw is done — the provenance bundle included — its **last line** is:
  ```
  ==> nfclaw run finished <time>: <outcome>
  ```
  `--resume` appends, so a failed attempt is never overwritten by the retry; a relaunch nfclaw refuses before starting (invalid parameters, a non-empty `--outdir` without `--resume`) is appended too, so the last line is always the latest attempt's. A refused first attempt leaves a fresh `--outdir` untouched: no run log means nfclaw never launched there — run the command in the foreground to see why.
- **`<outdir>/.nextflow.log`** — Nextflow's own detailed log. Nextflow runs from `--outdir`, so its console hint "Check '.nextflow.log'" means this file, not one in your working directory.
- **`stdout.txt` / `stderr.txt` beside `run.log`** — Nextflow's two streams kept apart. Nextflow prints its error reports on stdout; stderr holds the launcher's update notice and, on a failure, the details some errors write there (nf-schema's list of invalid values).

Start a long run in the background with `nohup nfclaw run ... &` and stop it with `kill <nfclaw pid>` (the `pid:` line of the run log): nfclaw then shuts Nextflow and its tasks down, writes the bundle and closes the log, as on Ctrl-C. On Linux, parent-death signaling stops the direct Nextflow child if nfclaw is killed abruptly; detached tasks and containers still require the executor's cleanup and are not covered by that signal alone.

When a run fails, nfclaw's error quotes what Nextflow reported on stdout and stderr — plus the `Caused by:` chain from `.nextflow.log` when the console alone hides the reason (e.g. "Unable to parse config file" ← "Network is unreachable") — and names these files by absolute path, along with the failing task's `.command.err` (its `.command.log` and `.command.sh` sit beside it). `--check` launches nothing and writes no log.

---

## Replaying a run

`<outdir>/provenance/commands.sh` re-runs the recorded command. It reproduces the run into a **fresh** directory (default `<outdir>.replay`, or pass one: `./commands.sh /path/to/fresh-dir`) and refuses a target that already holds files. That is deliberate: an nf-core pipeline publishes into `--outdir` and cannot re-publish over a previous run's files, so replaying in place fails immediately on `pipeline_info/execution_trace_*.txt` (and on sarek's `manifest_*.bco.json`). A replay re-executes the pipeline — it is a reproduction, not a `--resume` — and the result can be compared against the original bundle's `outputs.sha256`. It logs itself the same way, to `<target>/provenance/logs/run.log`, ending with its outcome: `nfclaw status <target>` reads it, and `kill <replay pid>` stops Nextflow with it.

Before launching Nextflow, `commands.sh` runs `provenance/replay_guard.py` against the original bundle. The guard checks the recorded pipeline revision and tracked source bytes (`pipeline.sha256`), declared local input content including data paths referenced in samplesheets (`inputs.sha256`), and parameters and configuration (`configs.sha256`). Changed or missing dependencies and incomplete bundles are refused, rather than producing silently divergent scientific results. New replay bundles acquire the same output-directory writer lock as `nfclaw run`, so overlapping runs and replays cannot write into that directory concurrently.

Invoke `commands.sh` by an absolute or relative path. Moving a bundle preserves its internal params/config paths; external inputs, user configs and pipeline source must still exist at their recorded paths and pass their checksum checks.

Trust `skill.md` / `reference.md` over your own memory — they are generated from the pinned commit. To set any parameter beyond the essentials, look it up in `pipelines/<name>/reference.md` (the complete list, with allowed values and value constraints) — do not invent a flag or value. `nfclaw run` rejects unknown flags, invalid allowed values and unambiguous scalar/shape errors before it starts; `nf-schema` remains authoritative for the complete schema (especially conditionals and complex constraints) at runtime. Only read `upstream/` for deep dives.

## To chain pipelines (A, then B, then C)

Several pipelines in sequence — each stage starts only after the previous one **succeeded**, and its inputs are prepared from that stage's outputs (fetchngs → rnaseq: fetchngs's samplesheet becomes rnaseq's `--input`). Write a spec (JSON) and run it:
```json
{
  "nxf_env": {"NXF_JVM_ARGS": "-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true"},
  "stages": [
    {"pipeline": "fetchngs", "input": "/abs/ids.csv", "retries": 2},
    {"pipeline": "rnaseq", "params": {"genome": "GRCh38"}}
  ]
}
```

Preflight check first:
```bash
nfclaw chain run spec.json --outdir /abs/chain --check
```
It validates every stage, every handoff, and verifies that every stage's config parses with its target engine (`nextflow config`), leaving `--outdir` untouched — then run the same without `--check`. Unavailable engines and timed-out configuration probes block the chain before any stage launches.

Which pipeline can follow which: `nfclaw chain edges [name]`, or the `## Chaining` section of a `skill.md`; without a rule there is no chain (or give the stage an inline `"handoff"`).

- **Stage parameters:** A stage's `params` are its own flags (look them up in its `reference.md`); the handed-over ones (rnaseq's `--input`) are not yours to set. `demo: true` adds that release's `test` profile.
- **Engine tuning:** Run options (`profile`, `nxf_ver`, `nxf_env`, `config`, `limits`) go on the chain or on a stage: releases of different ages can need different engines (`"nxf_ver": "25.10.4"` on an older one).
- **Chain locking:** Concurrent chain processes targeting the same `--outdir` are blocked by an exclusive POSIX flock on `<outdir>/chain/.lock`.
- **Logs and state:** Each stage is an ordinary run in `<outdir>/NN-<stage>/`, with its own run log and provenance. The chain logs to `<outdir>/chain/logs/chain.log`; its **last line** is `==> nfclaw chain finished <time>: <outcome>` — poll it with `tail -n 1` for a background chain (`nohup nfclaw chain run ... &`); `kill <pid>` stops it cleanly. Per-stage state: `<outdir>/chain/state.json`.
- **Verification and safety:** Before feeding stage outputs into a downstream stage, the handoff engine cryptographically verifies upstream files against `outputs.sha256`. Metagenomic assembly handoffs (fetchngs → mag, detaxizer → mag) isolate individual samples (`group: {sample}`) to avoid accidental multi-sample co-assembly pooling.
- **Resuming:** A failed chain continues with `nfclaw chain run [spec.json] --outdir /abs/chain --resume`: succeeded stages are skipped (and frozen), the failed one — which you may edit in the spec — resumes with Nextflow's cache. `"retries": N` relaunches a stage automatically after a pipeline failure (never after a validation error).
- **Lineage check:** `nfclaw chain status <outdir>` reconstructs the chain and verifies every link by SHA-256 (which run's outputs became which run's inputs); like `nfclaw status` (which also reads a chain's `--outdir`) it exits 0 succeeded, 3 still running, 1 otherwise — a chain whose nfclaw was killed outright is reported "stopped without an outcome". Spec, rules and failure modes: [`docs/chaining.md`](docs/chaining.md).

## To run a specific (non-latest) version

The default is always the pinned latest release. To run any other published release instead:

1. **List releases:** `nfclaw versions <name>` (the pinned latest is flagged).
2. **Read that version's docs:** `nfclaw show <name> --pipeline-version X.Y.Z` — it fetches the tag, materializes it under `pipelines/<name>/.versions/X.Y.Z/` (git-ignored), and prints the `skill.md` generated from *that* release's schema (a `reference.md` is written alongside it). The params, flags and validation all come from X.Y.Z, not from latest.
3. **Run it:**
   ```bash
   nfclaw run <name> --pipeline-version X.Y.Z --input samplesheet.csv --outdir results -profile docker
   ```

Only real release tags are accepted (`X.Y.Z`, or the `X.Y` of older nf-core releases such as fetchngs `1.9`; with or without a leading `v`) — plus `dev`, below; an unknown version fails fast and lists what is available. Provenance records the exact version that ran.

---

## To run unreleased development code (`dev`)

Every nf-core pipeline develops on a `dev` branch and releases from it, so `dev` holds the changes that are not in any release yet. To run it (the `nextflow run nf-core/<name> -r dev` equivalent):
```bash
nfclaw run <name> --pipeline-version dev --input samplesheet.csv --outdir results -profile docker
```
Every other flag works as for a release, e.g.:
```bash
nfclaw run fetchngs --pipeline-version dev --input ids.csv --outdir /path/to/out -profile binac2 --nxf-ver 25.10.4
```

- **Commit anchoring:** `dev` moves, so each run resolves it to the branch's **current head commit** and materializes that commit under `pipelines/<name>/.versions/dev-<commit12>/` (git-ignored, one immutable tree per commit, so a replay or a concurrent run never sees the code change). The run prints a warning naming the commit; provenance records `version: dev` plus that exact commit, and `commands.sh` replays it.
- **Documentation:** Read its docs first — params can differ from the release: `nfclaw show <name> --pipeline-version dev` prints the `skill.md` generated from that commit (`reference.md` is written beside it).
- **Listing:** `nfclaw versions <name>` lists `dev` (with its head commit) after the releases.
- **Offline behavior:** Offline, nfclaw falls back to the last `dev` head it fetched and says so; a pipeline with no `dev` branch fails fast. `--resume` warns when `dev` moved since the run it continues (Nextflow then re-runs only the tasks the change touched).

Prefer a release for results you need to reproduce from a version number; use `dev` for fixes or features that are not released yet.

---

## Tuning the Nextflow engine / environment

`nfclaw run` inherits your shell environment and passes it through to Nextflow. Two run flags make the engine and its runtime explicit and reproducible (both are recorded in `<outdir>/provenance/`):

- **`--nxf-ver X.Y.Z`** — pin the Nextflow engine for this run (sets `NXF_VER`). Use it when a newer Nextflow breaks an older pipeline release (e.g. a config-parser change in a new Nextflow major), or to reproduce a prior run exactly. nfclaw judges the version requirement against this pin.
- **`--nxf-env KEY=VALUE`** — set an `NXF_*` variable for this run (repeatable). Common fixes:
  - IPv6-only host where the JVM can't reach GitHub for remote configs:
    `--nxf-env NXF_JVM_ARGS=-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true`
  - skip remote config fetches entirely:
    `--nxf-env NXF_OFFLINE=true`
- **`--config PATH` (or `-c`, repeatable)** — pass an extra Nextflow config straight through (`-c`), e.g. a docker host-network config (`docker { runOptions = "--network host" }`) or custom resources.

---

## Running on a machine smaller than the pipeline assumes

nf-core sizes every process from a label in the pipeline's `conf/base.config`, tuned for a server: one step can request far more memory than a workstation has (`Process requirement exceeds available memory`), and Nextflow retries a failed step with *more*. `--demo` never shows this because nf-core's `test` profile ships its own small ceiling; a real run has none. Set one:
```bash
nfclaw run <name> ... --limit-cpus 4 --limit-memory 15.GB --limit-time 1.h
```

These become Nextflow's `process.resourceLimits` — the ceiling nf-core documents — applied to every process and every retry, so one flag covers whatever the pipeline asks for next. Do not chase this with `withName:` overrides: those re-size one named process's initial request, so you must name every step that could exceed the host, and they do not cap the retry. The generated config is written to `<outdir>/provenance/resource_limits.config` and replayed by `commands.sh`.

Any other environment (proxies, `JAVA_HOME`, …) is inherited from your shell unchanged. Each run launches Nextflow from its `--outdir`, so its `.nextflow/` history is isolated and `--resume` resumes that run (use a distinct `--outdir` per pipeline).

If a pipeline's `upstream/` is empty, initialise it first:
```bash
git submodule update --init pipelines/<name>/upstream
```

---

## Requirements (agent environment)

- **Git**
- **Python 3.11+** (install nfclaw with `pip install -e .`)
- **Nextflow** (Java 17+)
- **Docker** or **Singularity/Apptainer**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Use a space-free path on macOS and Linux:** Many bioinformatics tools and Nextflow's work directory mishandle spaces in paths; on macOS also avoid iCloud paths.

---

## Checking a replay

```bash
nfclaw verify <replay-outdir> --against <original-outdir>
```

Hashes the replay's live files and compares them **by path** with the original recorded `outputs.sha256` (or live originals when no manifest exists). It reports `identical` / `changed` / `missing` / `extra`. Missing or extra files fail the structural check. Changed bytes may reflect metadata or different scientific results; inspect them using a format-aware comparison. File structure alone establishes no analytical agreement. Add `--strict` to require identical bytes and fail on any changed file.

Replay requires Python 3 and checks the recorded local data, configurations, parameters and tracked pipeline source before launching. A changed dependency or incomplete bundle is refused. It pins the observed engine version, but remote inputs, indirect configuration includes and container image digests are not frozen.

---

## Reference genomes

Some releases resolve a reference **remotely by default** — sarek defaults `--genome` to `GATK.GRCh38`, looked up in AWS iGenomes at `s3://ngi-igenomes/igenomes/` — so a run that passes no reference of its own reads from S3 and fails on a host without access to that bucket. Each `skill.md` states which case its pipeline is in under "Reference genome". Pass your own reference (`--fasta`, …) for a self-contained run, or `--igenomes-ignore true` to disable the lookup.

---

## Warnings are not failures

A run (and its replay, which executes the identical command) can print warnings that are **not** faults and are **not** nf-claw's: Nextflow reporting the `validation.*` config scope as unrecognised (its linter does not see plugin-contributed scopes — upstream nf-schema issue), a pinned release setting a parameter its own plugin removed (scrnaseq's `validationSchemaIgnoreParams` — `nfclaw run` neutralises this one at the config layer via nf-schema's `validation.ignoreParams` and prints an advisory recording that it did, leaving the pinned tree untouched), or a `test` profile that deliberately sets conflicting references (rnaseq's `--gtf` with `--gff`). They are catalogued with their real cause in [`docs/known-issues.md`](docs/known-issues.md) under "Warnings a run prints that are not faults". Check there before reporting one: nf-claw wraps releases **unmodified**, so an upstream warning is reproduced faithfully by design, not introduced.

---

## Run-time errors

Spaces in a path break many tools, so `nfclaw run` checks the repo path, the Nextflow work directory and `--outdir` **before** launching and **fails fast** naming the offending path (pass `--allow-spaces` to override) — a deterministic check, not a guess. For other failures (IPv6 host, no-network database downloads, a too-new Nextflow config parser, known upstream-pipeline bugs) the error quotes Nextflow's own report and names the run log, `.nextflow.log` and the failing task's files by absolute path (see [Where a run is logged](#where-a-run-is-logged--and-how-to-check-one)); the symptom→fix map is in [`docs/known-issues.md`](docs/known-issues.md).
